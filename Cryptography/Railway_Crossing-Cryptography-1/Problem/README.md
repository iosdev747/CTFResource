Grizzly and n00bie are at the Railway Station ready to solve the next challenge the hacker gives them. There they stumble upon a very suspicious piece of text "F{5CMLGRW@D0UN}A0NL5" with 3 lines drawn underneath. They believe this is part of the challenge but are unable to figure out what the text means. Help them decrypt the text. **Type Whole Flag in CAPS
